## Introduction:
In the fast-paced world of software development, staying up-to-date with version changes is crucial. However, repetitive tasks like manually updating version properties across multiple repositories can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this blog post, we'll explore a real-life example inspired by **James Surowiecki's** concept of `"addition by subtraction"` and discuss how automating version changes not only solves a common problem but also saves valuable time.

## The Friction Point:
Imagine a scenario where a software development team maintains different repositories for their projects. With each release, the team is required to manually update the version property in each repository, commit the changes, and raise a pull request. This process is not only tedious but also carries the risk of human error, potentially leading to inconsistent versioning across repositories.

## Drawing Inspiration from Lean Production:
**James Surowiecki's** observations about lean production in Japanese factories provide valuable insights into streamlining processes and eliminating waste. The Japanese companies identified points of friction in their manufacturing process and eliminated them, resulting in improved efficiency and product reliability. We can apply a similar approach to our version change problem by seeking to automate the process and eliminate repetitive effort.

## Automating Version Changes:
Recognizing the need for a more efficient solution, our development team decided to automate the version change process. They leveraged their knowledge of scripting and version control systems to create a custom solution that would save time and reduce the risk of errors.

## Implementation and Benefits:
The team developed a script that could automatically update the version property in all seven repositories simultaneously. With the new automated workflow, the process became as simple as executing a single command. The script would make the necessary changes, commit them, and even raise the pull request if desired.

## The Impact of Automation:
By implementing this automation, the development team experienced a significant reduction in the time and effort required for version changes. Previously, manually updating the version in each repository could take up to an hour per release. With the automated solution, the entire process was streamlined, saving them valuable time that could be better utilized for more critical tasks.

## Embracing the Philosophy of "Addition by Subtraction":
The successful automation of version changes aligns with James Surowiecki's concept of "addition by subtraction." By eliminating the friction points and wasteful effort associated with manual version updates, the team achieved greater efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, the reduced cognitive load resulting from a more streamlined process contributed to a more positive work environment.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, automating version changes in multiple repositories offers tangible benefits for software development teams. By adopting a lean approach inspired by the principles of "addition by subtraction," teams can identify repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as manual version updates, and develop automated solutions to streamline their workflows. Through automation, not only is valuable time saved, but the risk of errors is minimized, leading to increased efficiency and improved productivity.
