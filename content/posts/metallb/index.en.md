## Introduction
- MetalLB is an  <a href="https://github.com/metallb/metallb"> <i class="fab fa-github fa-fw"></i> </a>
  open-source load balancer for Kubernetes on bare metal hardware. 
- It solves the problem of load balancing in bare metal environments, where it's not natively available, leading to scalability and high availability limitations. 
- MetalLB supports layer 2 and layer 3 modes and can be customized to work with specific network topologies. 
- It's a reliable and scalable choice for organizations running Kubernetes on bare metal hardware. 
- MetalLB using standard routing protocols.

## Why - MetalLB

 - Kubernetes lacks a native implementation of network load-balancers (Services of type LoadBalancer) for bare metal clusters.
 - The built-in Network LB implementations in Kubernetes are designed to work with IaaS platforms like **GCP, AWS, and Azure**.
 - When attempting to create Load Balancers in a bare metal environment using the built-in Network LB implementations, they will remain in a **pending** state indefinitely.
 - This limitation can lead to scalability and high availability issues for organizations running Kubernetes on bare metal hardware.

## Prerequisites
 - Basic understanding of Kubernetes is necessary to use MetalLB.
 - You should know how to deploy applications on Kubernetes and create/manage Kubernetes objects using kubectl or `YAML manifests`.
 - MetalLB is designed to work with `Kubernetes clusters` running on bare metal hardware.

## Installation

Installing MetalLB in your Kubernetes cluster is a straightforward process. You can install MetalLB using either kubectl or Helm, depending on your preference.

Here are the steps to install MetalLB using kubectl:


```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.9/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```
The above command will deploy MetalLB to your cluster, under the **metallb-system** namespace.

## Configurations
  
  In order to assign IP to services. MetalLB must be instructed to do via **IPAddressPool**. 

  Layer 2 mode is the simplest to configure: in many cases, you donâ€™t need any protocol-specific configuration, **only IP addresses**.

For example, the following configuration gives MetalLB control over IPs from **152.16.16.240** to **152.16.16.250**

  In order to advertise the IP coming from an IPAddressPool, an **L2Advertisement** instance must be associated to the IPAddressPool.

## Conclusion

  - MetalLB is a reliable and scalable solution for load balancing on bare metal Kubernetes clusters. It is based on standard routing protocols and can handle large numbers of services and endpoints.
  - MetalLB is an open-source project that is available to anyone to use and contribute to. It is developed by a community of developers and maintained by the MetalLB team, ensuring ongoing development and support.

  Personally I use MetalLB for local on prem setup and automation.
